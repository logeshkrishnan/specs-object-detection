An object detection project where I've detected whether a person is wearing specs or not by first localising on the face using a face detection algorithm.

The face detection algorithm is OpenCV's Deep Learning face detector which uses SSD framework with a ResNet base network.

The object detection algorithm that i've used is ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco.
